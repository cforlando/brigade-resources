## About

Give a more in-depth description of the project. This can include:
* **Purpose** - How will it benefit the community?
* **Target Audience/Users** - Who will use and/or benefit from it?
* **Technologies Used** - Languages, frameworks, infrastructure, target version numbers
* **Screenshots/Images/Demo Videos** - Visuals are very effective but keep them up to date

## Project-specific

This and additional sections are subject to each project's needs. For example, a mobile application might list the app's structure and design rules while a backend service could show an example input/output for each endpoint. Provide any guidelines for making pull requests.

For code-based projects, you must include an **Installation** section which walks a new contributor through how to get the existing project running. [See here](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi#installation) for a thorough example. Include these subsections as necessary:

* **Dependencies**
* **Environment**
* **Install**
* **Deploy**
* **Test**

A simple version history or roadmap useful but not necessary. Limit any future plans to general milestones and leave the specifics to GitHub issues.
