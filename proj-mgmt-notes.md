# Procedures for Project Management (work in progress, feel free to add/alter)

Based on future discussions, the importance of some of these items may change.
The goal of this document is to identify the processes that need to be in place to be able to be successful in our goals for the organization.

## Establishing partner relationships
It's important to establish strong relationships with the organizations we partner with. We want their involvement in providing opportunities for our organization to help the community. We also want them to be satisfied with the product we build for them, and to be able to act as source and/or reference for future projects. Our organizational reputation is reflected on this; many of us do this as a way to gain experience or to put some projects under our belt. We shouldn't take on a project we can't complete to the satisfaction of both our organization and our partner.
Some projects (ex. Street Art Orlando) do not have an actual, physical "partner".  Many of these come from the mind of an innovator who saw a need and tried to fill it (Axel? :) ) I suggest that person should be considered the project champion, and should take the role of partner in the project (ex. defining goals, determining deliverables, etc.)

* **Who is the partner** - Who are we working with? Why? Is it a good organizational fit?
* **What is the need** - What does the partner need? Is it feasible to do? Do we have the skillset and bandwidth to deliver a project we can feel proud of? Is anyone doing this already? This is at a higher level than requirements gathering.
* **What resources are available** - Do we need input from the partner? (ex. data, contact person, subject matter expert, availability for meetings,  etc.)
* **What are the deliverables** -
	* We must agree with the partner on what they need and on what we can provide. If the partner does not have an IT team to maintain the system, we should consider that in the design process. We should communicate to the partner what they'll need to provide (ex. we donate 1 year hosting and they have to take over, they have to renew domain registration, etc. Many organizations know next to nothing about this type of thing.)
	* Explain donated code licensing.
	* Make sure the partner understands  what they can expect from us. This can prevent misunderstandings and sour relationships in the future.
	* Discuss support (or lack of) with the partner. Maintenance documentation? (ex. edit file index.html to change that text you may need to update often, backup these folders, etc.)
* **What is the project schedule** - Based on the resources available to the organization (ex. time, skillsets, bandwidth, project complexity, etc.) Again, higher level than requirement gathering
* **Should we take the project** - Does it align with our goals? Will it benefit the community and the organization? Are we comfortable that we can deliver?
* **Others**

## Requirements Gathering
* **What is the project schedule** - Based on the resources available to the organization (ex. time, skillsets, bandwidth, project complexity, etc.)
* **What resources are we committing to the project** - Who, what, when
*  **Communication Plan** - Do we need to communicate milestones? project progress? developer questions? Who is communicating? With whom?
*  **Project Progress Visibility** - How do we communicate project status? task status? Kanban? Gantt? do we care?
*  **Testing/acceptance criteria/script** - we need our partner involved

## Design
*  **Who is involved?** - lead developer? governance? partner?
*  **Best stack/platform?** - usually whatever the developer has expertise in. Should we consider the partner's environment (if they are hosting the system)?
* **Design phase may be a good intro to new members** - good to get out of the box ideas,  can minimize damage caused, can help gauge engagement

## Development
*  **Who is involved?**
* **Development methodology** - Up to developers? Particular methods preferred by the organization?
* **Documentation** - When, where, how? If a partner comes back to us a year later and the original dev is gone, do we have enough info to aid the partner? Should we?

## Testing
*  **Different team/team member(s) than developer**
*  **Partner/Stakeholders**
*  **Does it meet org standards?**

## Implementation
* **Establish implementation plan with dev team and partner**
* **Governance team aware and involved**
* **Failover plan** - Do we need one?

## Maintenance/Post-Implementation Support
* **What did we promise the partner?** - Did we commit to any type of support? did we refer them to a source of support?
* **Were the goals met?**
* **Do we have suggestions for future projects?**
* **Update our stakeholders** - Successful project? Let's tell people about it! CFA, members, partners, etc.
